# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I think I watched 100% of videos

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have planned to watch some of the videos on Monday, and the rest on Tuesday. There is no scheduled time, just complete it by Tuesday, and I watched the videos just in my room, I don't go anywhere, or have a location to go and study.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm submitting pracs on time and watching the videos

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I currently haven't scheduled time for studying previous week's content. And although I watched all the videos, I only watched most before the lecture and the rest later that week.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I don't carefully read the question/ information given, I find that I usually miss important information, even when I go back and read the question two or three times. Another thing is that I have developed bad habits when coding.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Submitting on time, getting down coding patterns
