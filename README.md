# Introduction
Hello, i'm Corey Camilleri a JCU student learning an bachelor of Information and Technology. This repo will contain my 
journey of learning code, with each week containing recently learnt coding techniques.

## Three+ main lessons learnt about clean coding

- Follow patterns
- Be consistent - naming conventions
- Don't create an instance and destroy it - be efficient
- Don't unnecessary complicate the code
