# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

It usually took 2 hours to do most of the practical, with 2-3 hours for the do-it-yourself exercise. With the accuracy
of the estimate for the last task being 2 hours.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

The estimate improve slightly, instead of estimating 2 hours, I went to 3, which was more accurate.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Coding takes more time than expected.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I need to write more/ better functions.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I haven't got a mention from any other person, but I did review myself, and found many mistakes.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

The only problem I found, was when we had assignments that need idmetidate action, but instead of doing the assignment,
I had to spend 5 hours working on the practical, adds more stress.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Understanding the code.
